# WSU CPTS 437 Semester Project: Discord message author identification

This program trains a model using sklearn's Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to classify the author of a Discord message based on 
training data consisting of at least 100 of that user's messages mixed in with an additional 700-1000 messages. The data used 
to train and test this program consists of 763 chat messages from 6 different users, though this could be expanded with some minor modifications.
